# Requirements:

# Install nginx on your web-01
# server
# Nginx should be listening on port 80
# When querying Nginx at its root / with a GET request (requesting a page) using curl, it must return a page that contains the string Hello World!
# As an answer file, write a Bash script that configures a new Ubuntu machine to respect above requirements (this script will be run on the server itself)
# You canâ€™t use systemctl for restarting nginx

# Check if nginx is installed

# Ensure nginx is listening to port 80
ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'

# Set up the default page
echo "Hello World!" | sudo tee /var/www/html/index.html > /dev/null

# Restart nginx (without using systemctl)
sudo service nginx restart
