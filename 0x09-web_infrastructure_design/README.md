## Learning Objectives

### General

* You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
* You must be able to explain what each component is doing
* You must be able to explain system redundancy
* Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

Each file in this repository holds a visual drawing of web infrastructures, from a simple infrastructure, to a distributed infrastructure, to a secured and monitored infrastructure, to a scalable infrastructure. Each builds on the other and/or more components are added on. 

## Tasks

| Task | File |
| ---- | ---- |
| 0. Simple web stack | [0-simple_web_stack](./0-simple_web_stack) |
| 1. Distributed web infrastructure | [1-distributed_web_infrastructure](./1-distributed_web_infrastructure) |
| 2. Secured and monitored web infrastructure | [2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure](./2-secured_and_monitored_web_infrastructure) |
